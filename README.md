# Gig Economy Catalog App

This application written using the Flask framework allows users to securely sign-in with OAuth 2.0 and add information about the gig economy platforms they are participating in. Authentication ensures that users cannot modify content that they themselves did not input into the app. New users can explore categories and find gig economy platforms that suits them from user generated content. The data is accessible via JSON API endpoints.
